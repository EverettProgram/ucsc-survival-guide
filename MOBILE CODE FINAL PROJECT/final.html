                                        <p> Lecture styles vary greatly from speaker to speaker.
                                        Some lecturers are beautifully organized, some ramble,
                                        some present an hour of anecdotes and leave the student
                                        to determine their significance.

                                        It is imperative that you figure out a lecturer's style.
                                        In the case of the rambler or story teller, you may find
                                        yourself at the end of an hour with only a sentence or
                                        two written down. Check with other students, but don't be
                                        surprised if it works out that your sentences do, indeed,
                                        represent the crucial points of the lecture. </p>

Whether you want to go downtown, to the beach, the boardwalk, or your friend's house off campus, the metro bus system will help you get there! At first it's confusing figuring out the routes, but I promise it gets easier. For these, you do have to show ID. </p> <p>Tip: If you don't have yours, make up a convincing story and maybe cry a little bit to the bus driver. </p> 
                        
                        <p>While all of the Metro buses run through downtown, the 10, 15, or 16 will get you there the fastest. Bus 19 & 20 are the best if you want to hit the beach!</p>

					<h4>Terms</h4>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Class Numbers:</b>
						<p></p>
						Every course has a five-digit class number which is used for enrollment. The class number appears at the top in the MyUCSC Class Search. 
						The Class Detail page of a Class Search indicates whether the course is an Interview Only course requiring instructor consent. 
						To enroll in one of these classes, read the section on Enrollment Conditions for Interview Only courses on page 12. 
						Obtain a permission number from the instructor or department in order to enroll.
						To enroll in independent study, you must first pick up a petition for independent study at the department, college, or division office and obtain the approval of the UCSC instructor who will supervise your study. 
						Next, the sponsoring agency will assign a class number for you to use to enroll online.
							
					</li>
				
					<p></p>
					<li><b>Requirements (Prerequisites and Restrictions):</b>	
						<p></p>
						<ul>
							<li>A class that has a prerequisite means that other courses must be completed or a placement exam must be satisfied before the course can be taken. 
								Classes for which a “D,” “F,” “NP,” “W,” or “I” is received do not satisfy prerequisite requirements.</li>

							<li>A class that has restrictions is available only to certain categories of students.</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
						Refer to the <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/index.html">Programs and Courses</a> section of the UCSC General Catalog to determine the prerequisites or restrictions of a class.
						<p></p>
						<b>Prerequisites satisfied at other institutions:</b>
							<p></p>
							If you believe course work completed at another institution satisfies a prerequisite, contact the department sponsoring the class.
					</li>
					
					<li><h4>Secondary Discussion Sections/Labs:</h4>
						A section is a smaller discussion group or lab class which is taken as part of a credit course, but no credit is awarded. Secondary sections/labs are listed with the main lecture in AIS. Not all secondary sections require enrollment.
					</li>		
						
					<li><h4>Wait Lists:</h4>
						Students may sign up for a wait list after all students, new and continuing, have had the opportunity to enroll.
						<p></p>
						Students may sign up for up to 10 wait list credits. You should see a Wait List Appointment period on MyUCSC with you other enrollment appointments. Departments that do not have a wait list in MyUCSC may have an internal wait-list process.
						<p>For more information, including instructions and participating departments and classes, please visit the Office of the Registrar’s <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/faqs/students/wait-list/index.html">frequently asked questions on wait lists</a>. Be sure to check the FAQ web site for updated wait-list information.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><h4>Class Permission Numbers</h4>
						<p>A class permission number is an assigned number that allows you to enroll in a class. It is specific to a class and can be used only once. After an unsuccessful attempt to add a class, the number may be used again.</p>
						<p>To obtain a class permission number, consult with the instructor or department.</p>
						<p>A class permission number overrides course restrictions and/or prerequisites, and overrides the closed (full) status of a class.</p>
						<p>Class permission numbers cannot override time conflicts, your maximum allowed units, holds, or a closed (full) discussion section.</p>

					<p></p>
					For the first phase, you can only enroll in--not waitlist--classes. The maximum amount of units you are allowed to enroll in is dependent on your class level.
					If you are considered a freshman (under 44.9 completed credits), a sophomore (under 89.9 credits), or a junior (under 134.9 credits), you are allowed to enroll in a maximum of 14 units.
					If you are considered a senior (over 134.9 credits), you are allowed to enroll in up to 19 units in this phase.

				<p></p>
				<li><b>Phase 2:</b>
					<p></p>
					For the second phase, you can enroll in up to 19 units regardless of your class level. This number includes the classes you enrolled in from the first phase.
					You can also waitlist up to 10 units.
					</li>
				<p></p>
				<li><b>Holds on Enrollment</b>
					<p></p>
					A hold may be placed on your enrollment for various reasons, including unpaid debts, junior standing without a declared major, and others. When you attempt to enroll in MyUCSC, a hold creates an error message. 
					Students may view their holds by logging on to the MyUCSC portal and clicking on the Student Center. Information on how to remove each hold is included.

						<li>if you were anticipating transfer credit to change your academic level, or if you check your credits and still believe the academic level is wrong, call the Registrar’s office;</li>
						<li>if you planned to study abroad with the Education Abroad Program (EAP) but your plans have changed, contact your EAP adviser;</li>
						<li>if you applied to graduate and your plans have changed, reapply to graduate. For more information, see Apply/Reapply to Graduate.</li>

			<h2>Other Information</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Concurrent Enrollment:</h4>
						The Enrollment Information box in a MyUCSC Class Search will indicate previous or concurrent enrollment in another class is required. For example, if you enroll in BIOL-130L-01, you should concurrently enroll in the associated class, which is BIOL-130-01.
						<p></p>
						The term, “concurrent enrollment,” can be confusing. Please note:
							<ul>
								<li>it is not the same as a discussion section (see Secondary Discussion Sections/Labs above);</li>
								<li>it is not the same as concurrent enrollment through UC Extension, in which a person enrolls in a regular Open University course as an Extension student.</li>	
							</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><h4>Time Conflicts</h4>
					<b>Why you might have a time conflict</b>
						<p>Courses which have the same start and end times are considered a time conflict. Check the Schedule of Classes for the most up-to-date class information.</p>
					<b>How to resolve a time conflict</b>
						<p>If your classes overlap but you and your instructors believe that you can complete both classes in spite of the conflict, you should call the Office of the Registrar at 459-4412 for assistance. Some classes require written approval from the faculty.</p>
				</li>
			
				<li><h4>Retaining Enrollments</h4>
					<p>To retain a seat in your classes, you must attend the first class meeting. Instructors may administratively drop anyone who does not attend.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><h4>Enrolling after Instruction Begins</h4>
					<p>Attend the first class meeting of any classes you want to add. Permission numbers are required for all classes after the seventh day of instruction but may be required earlier. If necessary, the instructor will issue a class permission number.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><h4>Verify Your Enrollments</h4>
					<p>It is recommended that you verify your classes and grade options, via MyUCSC, after you complete your enrollment transactions. It is also recommended that you verify your enrollments and print your Class Schedule before the end of the Add/Drop/Swap period. Print your Class Schedule from the Student Center by clicking on Enroll and then clicking on the My Class Schedule tab.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><h4>Pass/No Pass Grading Option</h4>
					<p>Students in good academic standing may elect the Pass/No Pass grading option and may change their grading option in a course up to the 15th day of instruction. For the Pass/No Pass option, students receive a P for work that is performed at C or clearly passing level or better. 
						For work that is not clearly passing, no academic credit is awarded; and students receive a NP (No Pass). Beginning fall 2001, the grade notation NP appears on the official transcript in all cases, regardless of when a student was admitted. For work that is passing, but incomplete, the grade notation I (Incomplete) may be issued.</p>
					<p>Students on probationary academic standing who elect the Pass/No Pass grading option will have their grading option changed back to graded after the Add by Petition deadline.</p>
