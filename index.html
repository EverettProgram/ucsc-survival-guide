		<h1>Effective Note Taking</h1>
		<p>Lecture styles vary greatly from speaker to speaker. Some lecturers are beautifully organized, some ramble, some present an hour of anecdotes and leave the student to determine their significance.<br>
		<br>
		It is imperative that you figure out a lecturer's style. In the case of the rambler or story teller, you may find yourself at the end of an hour with only a sentence or two written down. Check with other students, but don't be surprised if it works out that your sentences do, indeed, represent the crucial points of the lecture.</p><br>

			<h1>How to Prepare for Tests</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Familiarize yourself with the test. Ask the professor how long it will be and what kind of questions will be on it.</li>
				<li>Ask what you should focus on</li>
				
				<li>Overview all the work to be done and schedule time to do it. On the basis of your familiarity with the test, make a list of all the tasks you must complete to prepare for it.</li>
				
				<li>Avoid the "escape syndrome". If you find yourself fretting or talking about your work rather than studying, relax for a few minutes and START WORKING.</li>
				
				<li>Deal with unread materials. Decide what parts in the reading you can omit, what parts you can skim, and what parts you want to read. Set time limits for each part, and keep to the limits.</li>
				
				<li>Review actively. Integrate notes, text, and supplementary information onto summary sheets by diagramming, charting, outlining, categorizing in tables, or simply writing paragraph summaries of the information.</li>
				
				<li>Remember, the single most effective way to prepare for any test is to practice doing what you will have to do on the test.</li>
				
				<li>It is frequently useful to study with other well-prepared students and to attend any review sessions if available.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div data-inline="true" data-role="collapsible">
			<h1>How to Prepare for Essays</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Begin your preparation by reading your instructor's course description and syllabus and then writing down whatever assumptions, biases, and teaching objectives are stated or implied in these materials.</li>
				
				<li>Read assignments and listen to lectures and discussions with the purpose of determining how the course content supports the major themes and answers the major questions you have generated from the course description and syllabus. Modify and refine these themes and questions throughout the course as you gain additional information.</li>
				
				<li>At some point prior to the test - preferably a week or two before - quickly look over your notes and the chapter headings from your readings. From this overview, generate a list of major topics for the course material covered. For each major topic, create a summary sheet of all the relevant factual data that relates to that topic.</li>
				
				<li>In addition to learning the factual material, determine any logical relationships among topics. These relationships are often predictive of essay test questions. For example, if, in a history course, you find that two political movements are noticeably similar, then your instructor may very well ask you to compare and contrast the two movements. Generate a list of possible essay questions and consider setting up and answering as many of these questions as time permits.</li>

			<p id="intro">Student Media's mission is to provide UCSC students an opportunity to explore, discover, and share local and global issues through the mediums of print and broadcast. This mission is achieved by challenging students to think critically about the environment they operate within, and by giving students the tools and the agency to create a media dialogue about that environment. The result is a diverse community of students operating in a multitude of organizations, creating a variety of content and transforming themselves in ways that will inform their work beyond graduation. Currently, Student Media houses 16 various student organizations and media outlets- 11 print publications and five TV/video productions.

			<h4>Terms</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Class Numbers:</b>
					<p></p>Every course has a five-digit class number which is used for enrollment. The class number appears at the top in the MyUCSC Class Search. The Class Detail page of a Class Search indicates whether the course is an Interview Only course requiring instructor consent. To enroll in one of these classes, read the section on Enrollment Conditions for Interview Only courses on page 12. Obtain a permission number from the instructor or department in order to enroll. To enroll in independent study, you must first pick up a petition for independent study at the department, college, or division office and obtain the approval of the UCSC instructor who will supervise your study. Next, the sponsoring agency will assign a class number for you to use to enroll online.

				<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Requirements (Prerequisites and Restrictions):</b>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li>A class that has a prerequisite means that other courses must be completed or a placement exam must be satisfied before the course can be taken. Classes for which a “D,” “F,” “NP,” “W,” or “I” is received do not satisfy prerequisite requirements.</li>
						<li>A class that has restrictions is available only to certain categories of students.</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>Refer to the <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/index.html" target="_blank">Programs and Courses</a> section of the UCSC General Catalog to determine the prerequisites or restrictions of a class.
					<p></p><b>Prerequisites satisfied at other institutions:</b>
					<p></p>If you believe course work completed at another institution satisfies a prerequisite, contact the department sponsoring the class.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Secondary Discussion Sections/Labs:</h4>A section is a smaller discussion group or lab class which is taken as part of a credit course, but no credit is awarded. Secondary sections/labs are listed with the main lecture in AIS. Not all secondary sections require enrollment.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Wait Lists:</h4>Students may sign up for a wait list after all students, new and continuing, have had the opportunity to enroll.
					<p></p>Students may sign up for up to 10 wait list credits. You should see a Wait List Appointment period on MyUCSC with you other enrollment appointments. Departments that do not have a wait list in MyUCSC may have an internal wait-list process.
					<p>For more information, including instructions and participating departments and classes, please visit the Office of the Registrar’s <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/faqs/students/wait-list/index.html" target="_blank">frequently asked questions on wait lists</a>. Be sure to check the FAQ web site for updated wait-list information.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Class Permission Numbers</h4>
					<p>A class permission number is an assigned number that allows you to enroll in a class. It is specific to a class and can be used only once. After an unsuccessful attempt to add a class, the number may be used again.</p>
					<p>To obtain a class permission number, consult with the instructor or department.</p>
					<p>A class permission number overrides course restrictions and/or prerequisites, and overrides the closed (full) status of a class.</p>
					<p>Class permission numbers cannot override time conflicts, your maximum allowed units, holds, or a closed (full) discussion section.</p>

					<p>Undergraduate students are expected to take a minimum of 15 credits and may enroll in up to 19 credits. Graduate students are expected to enroll in at least 10 credits and no more than 19 credits. Undergraduates who have a 3.0 cumulative grade point average may enroll in up to 22 credits beginning the first day of instruction. If you wish to take a nonstandard course load, meet with your college academic preceptor or graduate adviser who will update the system if the nonstandard courseload is approved so that you can complete enrollment.</p><b>When minimum credits are enforced</b>
					<p>Minimum credits are not enforced until a few days prior to the start of instruction. (For the date, see the Academic and Administrative Calendar.) Once minimum credits are enforced, you will not be able to drop below the minimum unless you obtain approval from your academic preceptor or graduate adviser. To drop a course and add another, use the swap function. Financial aid recipients should be cautious; certain aid will not be disbursed if enrollment is less than full-time.</p><b>When maximum credits are enforced</b>

			<h2>Other Information</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Concurrent Enrollment:</h4>The Enrollment Information box in a MyUCSC Class Search will indicate previous or concurrent enrollment in another class is required. For example, if you enroll in BIOL-130L-01, you should concurrently enroll in the associated class, which is BIOL-130-01.
					<p></p>The term, “concurrent enrollment,” can be confusing. Please note:
					<ul>
						<li>it is not the same as a discussion section (see Secondary Discussion Sections/Labs above);</li>
						<li>it is not the same as concurrent enrollment through UC Extension, in which a person enrolls in a regular Open University course as an Extension student.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Time Conflicts</h4><b>Why you might have a time conflict</b>
					<p>Courses which have the same start and end times are considered a time conflict. Check the Schedule of Classes for the most up-to-date class information.</p><b>How to resolve a time conflict</b>
					<p>If your classes overlap but you and your instructors believe that you can complete both classes in spite of the conflict, you should call the Office of the Registrar at 459-4412 for assistance. Some classes require written approval from the faculty.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Retaining Enrollments</h4>
					<p>To retain a seat in your classes, you must attend the first class meeting. Instructors may administratively drop anyone who does not attend.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Enrolling after Instruction Begins</h4>
					<p>Attend the first class meeting of any classes you want to add. Permission numbers are required for all classes after the seventh day of instruction but may be required earlier. If necessary, the instructor will issue a class permission number.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Verify Your Enrollments</h4>
					<p>It is recommended that you verify your classes and grade options, via MyUCSC, after you complete your enrollment transactions. It is also recommended that you verify your enrollments and print your Class Schedule before the end of the Add/Drop/Swap period. Print your Class Schedule from the Student Center by clicking on Enroll and then clicking on the My Class Schedule tab.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Pass/No Pass Grading Option</h4>
					<p>Students in good academic standing may elect the Pass/No Pass grading option and may change their grading option in a course up to the 15th day of instruction. For the Pass/No Pass option, students receive a P for work that is performed at C or clearly passing level or better. For work that is not clearly passing, no academic credit is awarded; and students receive a NP (No Pass). Beginning fall 2001, the grade notation NP appears on the official transcript in all cases, regardless of when a student was admitted. For work that is passing, but incomplete, the grade notation I (Incomplete) may be issued.</p>
					<p>Students on probationary academic standing who elect the Pass/No Pass grading option will have their grading option changed back to graded after the Add by Petition deadline.</p>
